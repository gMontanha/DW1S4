        <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
            Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
                While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
            As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
            “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
                        Only this and nothing more.”

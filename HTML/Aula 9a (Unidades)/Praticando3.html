            My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, and
            a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little
            puffy, I’ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand 
            now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use
            a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an 
            exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an <span class = green><span>herb-mint facial masque</span></span> which I leave on for 10
            minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion 
            with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.
            Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing 
            protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman. Some kind of abstraction. 
            But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold
            gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense
            our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.
